\chapter{Introduction}
NTRU is a public key cryptosystem which allows two remote parties to communicate in a secure way without sharing a secret key. 
NTRU is expected to be secure against the future quantum computer. In this project, we will analyze the security of NTRU.
We will try to improve the existing attacks on NTRU, or to develop new attacks against NTRU. Math (more specifically, lattice), programming and algorithms are needed in this project.
 The program is available at
