\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Ending Statement}
In a nutshell, we have gain knowledge on the characteristics of lattice-based cryptography specifically NTRU.
Moreover, we examined its attacks and flaws to understand the security of NTRU.
Conversely, I strongly believe that overall NTRU remains as secure and can be used universally. 
This concludes our project (readily available at \url{https://github.com/charutomo/Security-Evaluation-of-NTRU-Public-Key-Cryptosystem}) and feel free to contact us via email for further enquires. Thank you for your upmost support.\\
